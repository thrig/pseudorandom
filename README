pseudorandom - Pseudo Random Distribution functions

for when you want the player's intuition that a coin flip "ought to"
come up heads after a run of misses. this intuition is of course totally
wrong but has its uses in games of not-so-much-as-usual chance

  (defpackage :foo
    (:use :common-lisp :pseudorandom))
  (in-package :foo)
  (destructuring-bind
      (rand reset)
      (prd-step 0.25 0.41675)
    (princ (funcall rand))
    (funcall reset))
